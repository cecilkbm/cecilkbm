# Hi and welcome!

I'm Cecil a Senior IT Consultant based in New York.

I build and secure whatever needs building and securing.

If there's a cybersecurity challenge or infrastructure problem, chances are I'll tackle it head-on.

My main tech stack is Python, C, C++, JavaScript, React, Terraform and Ansible. I'm equally comfortable automating infrastructure, writing low-level code, or building web applications.

I'm passionate about cybersecurity, infrastructure automation, and creating robust solutions that actually work in the real world.

Currently balancing grad school, research, and work. it's a wild ride but I love every minute of it!

### ⚡Fun Facts
  - I'm always reading something (tech books, research papers, or fiction to decompress).
  - You'll find me at tech conferences networking and learning about the latest in security and infrastructure.
  - CTF competitions are my thing - nothing beats the thrill of capturing that flag.
  - Anime enthusiast (because every good hacker needs a solid watch list).
  - I believe the best security solutions are the ones that don't get in people's way.

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on CTFs / Web Dev, DevOps & Security projects.
