# Cecil Boamah-Mensah 🦓

**` Infrastructure Engineering | Cybersecurity `**

I'm a Senior IT Consultant based in New York.
I build and secure whatever needs building and securing.
If there's a cybersecurity challenge or infrastructure problem, chances are I'll tackle it head-on.
My main tech stack is Python, C, C++, JavaScript, React, Terraform and Ansible. I'm equally comfortable automating infrastructure, writing low-level code, or building web applications.
I'm passionate about cybersecurity, infrastructure automation, and creating robust solutions that actually work in the real world.
Currently balancing grad school, research, and work. it's a wild ride but I love every minute of it!
